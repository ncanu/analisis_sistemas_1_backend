    Well tested to run on Glassfish/Payara Server

    <p>
        The project builds with Gradle, you can run on the command line: <i>gradlew build</i> and it will generate a war in /build/libs.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to deploy it directly to your web server (glassfihs/payara) you need to create a file on your application root named <i>gradle.properties</i> then create a property named 'serverHome' where your server is installed. for example: <i>C:\\developer\\payara41</i>
        <br>
        Now you can use a task named "deploy" <i>(gradlew deploy)</i> to deploy your application, just make sure your server is up!
